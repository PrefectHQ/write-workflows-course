<h2>Why workflow orchestration matters</h2>

<p>In data engineering and software development, orchestration refers to the process of coordinating and managing the
    various components of data pipelines and workflows.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Orchestration involves automating and scheduling the execution of data-related tasks and ensuring they run in the
    correct order, at the right time, and with the proper dependencies.</p>

<p>Key aspects of a strong orchestration solution include:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Workflow management:
        <ul>
            <li>Define, schedule, and execute sequences of tasks</li>
            <li>Manage dependencies between tasks</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Monitoring and observability:

        <ul>
            <li>Track the status and performance of workflows</li>
            <li>Provide visibility into the entire data pipeline</li>
            <li>Offer customizable logging behavior</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Error handling and recovery:

        <ul>
            <li>Detect and manage failures in workflows</li>
            <li>Implement automatic recovery mechanisms&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Scalability and infrastructure options:

        <ul>
            <li>Adapt resources to workflow needs</li>
            <li>Easily switch between development, staging, and production environments - locally and in the cloud</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>A strong orchestration solution is crucial for managing data workflows.</p>

<p>Without an orchestrator, processes are brittle, data engineering teams risk burnout, insights are slower to be
    received by management, and model training pipelines break more than they should. In sum, not having a strong
    orchestration solution means the organization has more headaches and less productivity than it should.</p>
